# Cl Ray Tracing
This is a simple offline renderer that uses ray tracing and Blinn-Phong reflection model.
It is implemented using clojure which is a functional programming language.

## Considerations:

+ Takes a lot of time to render a simple scene (as expected from ray tracing)
+ Aliasing problems.
